# ProxyServer-Rafael

MockCloud

Our team made a webapp that emulates the look, feel, and functionality of a SoundCloud song page.

Tech: React | NodeJS | Express| PostgreSQL | Docker | EC2 | S3 | Adobe XD

- Wireframed, prototyped, and made SVG files through Adobe Experience Design.
- Created the side-bar module of the webapp with the utilization of Styled-Components to help render dynamic pagination but also separate logic and styles.
- Automated build process with the use of the AWS' S3 and Grunt.
- Deployed micro-service with Docker on an AWS EC2 instance and bring together each of our teams' modules through a proxy server on another EC2 instance.
